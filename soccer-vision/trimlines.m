function segments = trimlines(rho, theta, H, W)
% time_lines  Takes in a vector of lines defined by rho and theta and
% outputs a vector of vector of segments, where the segments are segmented
% by the intersections of the lines, essentially there should be no
% crossings between lines after that. The lines must also be bounded the
% the edge of the screen (H,W = 240x320) window
%   
%   segments = trimelines(rho, theta)
%
% Example: rho = [50,50], theta = [0, 1.57], H = 100, W = 100
% 
% Output:
%   Seg1 = [(0, 50), (50, 50)]
% . Seg2 = [(50, 0), (50, 50)]
